dialog: "“After the battle of Hima, you and the army travel south.While traveling through the mountain pass, you spot a particularly funny looking man sitting on top of a rock. The sight of him brings many questions. As you approach him, you notice a freakishly large grin behind his mask.”,“Merchant - Well if it isn’t everyone's favorite new up and comer, Commander Kazuo.”,“Kazuo - You should get to safety, strange merchant, aren't you aware there's a war going on right now?”,“Merchant - That's ‘Mysterious Merchant’ to you young commander, a family title not to be lightly mistreated. War can be a very prosperous time for certain kinds of business. ”,Kazuo - “And what type of business is that?”,Merchant - ”Certain odds and ends. Food for coin, battle hardened men for supplies, trinkets that improve troop temperament for resources, you know the usual.”,“Kazuo - You’re selling large quantities of men, trained and battle hardened?”,“Merchant - Yup!”,“Kazuo - Care to tell me where they come from?”,“Merchant - Nope!”,“Kazuo grins to himself. This man is mysterious, but he has a certain charm to him. Without a goodbye, he vanishes into a ball of smoke. You chuckle to yourself, then continue south through the mountain passage.”"
